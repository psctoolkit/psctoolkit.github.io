How to exploit HPC and BigData for the **energy** transition?
Register to the EoCoE school, online 26-28 April 2022.

It is a program of Energy Oriented Center of Excellence that offers collaborative online learning opportunities with the theme "toward exascale for energy".
At the crossroads of the energy and digital revolutions, EoCoE develops and applies cutting-edge computational methods in its mission to accelerate the transition to the production, storage and management of clean, decarbonized energy.

As a Participant you will be given a chance to share your experience and learn more about EoCoE technical and industrial work. You will be taught for free and supported online by mentors specialists in each of event challenges.
During the hand-on sessions the use of EoCoE SaaS Portal will give you an access to high performance computing to conduct energy oriented simulations.
At the end of the event each participant will be awarded with certification.
