This tutorial will address the basic functionalities of the PSBLAS library for
the parallelization of computationally intensive scientific applications. We
will delve into the parallel implementation of iterative solvers for sparse
linear systems in a distributed memory paradigm, and look at the routines for
multiplying sparse matrices by dense matrices, solving block diagonal systems
with triangular diagonal entries, preprocessing sparse matrices, and several
additional routines for dense matrix operations. We will discuss both the direct
usage of the library in Fortran2003 and the usage of the C interfaces.

The tutorial will include examples relative to the EoCoE-II application areas,
and highlight how the PSBLAS environment can be used to obtain scalable
parallel codes.


This tutorial is part of the [Learn@EoCoE initiative](https://www.eocoe.eu/video_resource/psblas-3-6-sparse-matrices-computation-iterative-solvers-for-hpc-january-20th-2020/).
